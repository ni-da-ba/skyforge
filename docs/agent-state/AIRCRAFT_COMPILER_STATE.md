# Skyforge Aircraft Compiler state

**Program authority:** issue #545  
**Productionization boundary:** AIRCRAFT-PROD-002 / issue #618
**Frozen evidence only:** `aircraft-compiler-proof@0651bcee7dc879ab43db2f0b224f77e5026222bd`  
**Frozen implementation beneath checkpoint:** `cc020c872b9c53198cebbb0ae9094097f23c9c45`

This ledger records production capability only. The frozen AIRCRAFT-001 branch is evidence/source
material and must not be resumed, rebased into `main`, or merged wholesale.

## Productionized by AIRCRAFT-PROD-001

The current production foundation is backend-neutral and contains:

- `AircraftDesignSpec`, the finite mission/design-domain contract;
- `AircraftAnalyticalMath`, the accepted first-principles analytical primitives;
- `AircraftDesignCompiler`, deterministic exhaustive lexicographic constrained search;
- `AircraftDesignIR`, separating resolved geometry, mass/balance, metrics, solver evidence,
  validation scope, and the unapplied target boundary;
- `AircraftDesignIRJson` plus SHA-256 identity over deterministic production JSON;
- the Guild utility-monoplane v0.1 regression preserving the accepted analytical selection,
  rejection accounting, and equation-derived metrics.

The historical frozen v0.1 digest
`ac04df8a723f83a8ee0d19e01c0a375c34acccc2f33a5875b8efce47c985881c` remains provenance for the
Python prototype artifact. Production Java does not claim byte-for-byte serialization compatibility
with that prototype; its canonical JSON/SHA-256 identity is the production provenance boundary for
new downstream artifacts.

## Productionized by AIRCRAFT-PROD-002

On acceptance of issue #618, the production compiler also contains:

- explicit artifact identity plus exact source-design asset/digest provenance for blockspace;
- deterministic `x = nose_to_tail`, `y = up`, `z = starboard_positive` integer-lattice transcription;
- straight-taper scanline wing/tail surfaces, centerline fuselage spine, and orthogonal-only connectors;
- target-neutral propeller, CG, pilot, and cargo anchors as requirements rather than occupied cells;
- fail-closed six-neighbor connectivity, mirror-symmetry, propeller-clearance, CG-quantization, and dimensional-error validation;
- coordinate-unique semantic assembly planning that unions roles/capabilities without inventing target resources;
- canonical production JSON/SHA-256 identity for both blockspace and assembly artifacts.

## Frozen evidence not yet productionized

The frozen branch contains accepted evidence for later compiler/runtime stages, but that evidence is
not current-`main` production authority for:

- target placement/resource lowering and Create sail/state lowering;
- Sable primary/nested assembly, bounded Super Glue domains, and propulsion/governor topology;
- yaw mechanism, cockpit routing, player interaction, and moving-body tracking.

Those capabilities must be extracted through their own bounded production issues from current
`main`. Historical passing runtime evidence does not authorize bypassing current Integration Platform
contracts.

## Still unqualified / new aircraft work

The following remain unqualified as aircraft capabilities:

- completed-control persistence/save-reload;
- pitch;
- roll;
- multi-axis control;
- aircraft-level atmosphere envelope qualification;
- closed-loop stability/handling;
- stable powered flight;
- human flight/feel.

## Integration Platform dependency

Reusable Create/Sable/Simulated runtime seams are owned by issue #613. Aircraft may consume a seam
only when `docs/agent-state/COMPILER_INTEGRATION_CAPABILITIES.json` on accepted `main` explicitly
grants Agent B production authority for that capability. Until then, Aircraft must not reproduce or
work around the Platform fixture inside a complete aircraft.

## Next bounded aircraft tranche

After AIRCRAFT-PROD-002 is accepted on `main`, the next compiler tranche is target placement/resource
lowering over the production blockspace/assembly identities. Runtime Sable/Create realization must
consume only capabilities explicitly granted by `docs/agent-state/COMPILER_INTEGRATION_CAPABILITIES.json`;
persistence and new control-axis work remain downstream of those applicable Platform contracts.
